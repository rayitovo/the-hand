    -   Initialize `Strategist` with mock dependencies.

2.  **`strategist/` (Skeleton)**
    -   Create `strategy_loader.py` (stub for loading strategies).

5.  **`regime_info/` (Basic Classification)**
    -   Implement `technical_analyzer.py` (SMA, RSI).
    -   Create `regime_classifier.py` (simple threshold-based rules, e.g., "bull = SMA50 > SMA200").
    -   Skip ML/macro analysis for now.

---

#### **Phase 3: Strategy Execution** (done)
6.  **`trading_core/`**

    -   Add `event_logger.py` (log trades to CSV).

7.  **`simulation/`**

    -   Skip latency/slippage initially.

8.  **`trader/` (Stub)**
    -   Implement `exchange_connector.py` (mock API calls).

---

#### **Phase 4: Backtesting & Strategy Management** (done)
9.  **`backtester/`**
    -   Build `backtest_engine.py` (replay historical data).
    -   Add `report_generator.py` (basic metrics like profit/loss).

10. **`strategy/`**
    -   Define `base_strategy.py` (abstract class with required methods).
    -   Add one sample strategy in `approved/bull/ema_crossover.py`.

---

#### **Phase 5: Refinement & Scaling** (done)
11. **Enhance `regime_info/`**
    -   Add `macro_analyzer.py` (fetch CPI data via API).
    -   Upgrade `regime_classifier.py` with ML models.

12. **Expand `data_module/`**
    -   Implement `database_handler.py` (SQLite integration).
    -   Add support for multiple exchanges/APIs.

13. **Optimize Execution**
    -   Add latency/slippage to `simulation/`.
    -   Implement risk management in `trader/risk_manager.py`.

---

#### **Phase 6: Historical Regime Data and Backtesting Integration** (done)
14. **`regime_info/` (Historical Regime Data)**
    -   Implement `historical_regime_provider.py`:
        -   Fetch historical data from `data_module/` for a specified time range.
        -   Apply regime classification logic (using `technical_analyzer.py`, `macro_analyzer.py`, and `regime_classifier.py`) to historical data.
        -   Return a time series of regime labels corresponding to the historical period.
        
15. **Enhance `backtester/`**
    -   Modify `backtest_engine.py` to use the historical regime data from `regime_info/historical_regime_provider.py`.
        -   Ensure that the backtest is run under the correct historical regime conditions, using the time series of historical regime labels to switch strategies if needed.
        -   Make backtest configurable to run for specified time ranges.
    -   Implement `approval_manager.py`:
         -   Add logic for moving strategies from `strategy/to_test/` to `strategy/approved/` or `strategy/trash/` based on performance thresholds (e.g., Sharpe ratio, max drawdown).
    -   Update the backtest loop to automatically move strategies after testing.

#### **Phase 7: Strategy Development and Testing** (done)
16. **`strategy/`**
     - Create new folders inside the `to_test/` folder to simulate the real logic of testing the strategies.
     - Populate `strategy/to_test/` with at least two new strategies for different regimes.
     - Create a strategy validator in `strategy/strategy_validator.py`. This class should assert if the strategy was created correctly in `strategy/base_strategy.py` (with the required methods) to be used on the system.
    
17. **Backtesting workflow**
     - Develop a system for users to add new strategies to `strategy/to_test/` in the correct sub-folder.
     - Update `main.py` to run the `backtester/` on the `strategy/to_test` strategies.
     - Test a few strategies and confirm that they are correctly moved to `strategy/approved/` or `strategy/trash/` based on their performance in the backtest.

#### **Phase 8: Trader/Simulation Refinements** (done)

18. **`trader/`**
    -  Implement the complete `order_executor.py` to handle different types of orders (market, limit, OCO) using the actual exchange API.
    -   Set up a basic exchange connector with an actual (demo) API key to check if the connection is working.
    -   Update the `risk_manager.py` to incorporate stop-loss, take-profit, and other risk management features.
19. **`simulation/`**
    -   Implement `latency_engine.py` to add realistic delays to order execution.
    -   Update `virtual_exchange.py` to simulate partial fills and slippage based on the current order book.
20. **`trading_core/`**
    -   Implement `order_book.py` for level 2 market data handling.

#### **Phase 9:  Full System Integration**
21. **Integration**
    -   Integrate the new `trader/` and `simulation/` updates to work correctly with the `strategist/`, and the rest of the system.
22. **Full system test**
    -   Test the full system in simulation mode, making sure that it works with different regimes and strategies.
    -   If all tests were successful, prepare a final test for live execution on a demo account, and test again the complete workflow.
    -   Implement new unit tests for each module to have all functions and integrations correctly tested.

#### **Phase 10: Monitoring, Logging, and Refinement**
23. **`utils/`**
    -   Update `logger.py` to have more detailed logging options (logging to file, different log levels, etc).
    -   Implement a monitoring system for the application to be able to check the health of it.
    -   Implement alerts for critical events.
24. **Final Refinement**
    -   Refactor and clean up code based on the test experience.
    -   Update documentation and the README files.
    -   Deploy for live trading (use real credentials) if all tests were successfully made.
